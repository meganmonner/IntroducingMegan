Hello! My name is Megan Monner.
I was born and raised in Ottawa, living with my parents Mike Monner and Sharleen MacCarthy.
I attended Glen Cairn Public School in grade seven and eight.

I love drawing and anything artistic. I've always been interested in drawing and designing unique characters. I fancy writing short stories as well as reading them. Ocassionally I do poetry. As you can probably tell I'm very artistic, I don't enjoy sports AT ALL. I also enjoy watching youtube videos and doing adult coloring.

I don't really have a specific music taste. I tend to like anything, whether it's rock, hip-hop, or alternative/indie.
I do lean more towards the indie/alternative side of the broad musical spectrum. HOWEVER, I absolutely despise rap and country! Secondly, I have so many favourite songs! But my all-time favourite is probably Caress Your Soul by Sticky Fingers.

I don't have a favourite actor or actress, nor do I watch movies on a regular basis... but if I had to pick a favourite movie it would be Big Hero 6.
My favourite food is probably fruit (I like most fruit but I can't choose!. The reason being is that it's like a healthy dessert- full of essentiel vitamins and minerals but tastes sweet and sugary.

I don't have a part-time job but hope to get one soon in order to save up for post-secondary education (i.e college and/or university).

My strengths:
  I'm creative
  I'm patient
  I'm funny with my friends
  I'm open minded

My weaknesses:

  Somewhat of a slow learner
  Lack of concentration and motivation in things I don't enjoy or find interesting
  I'm not a very hard worker, but I try
  I have the memory of a goldfish

I speak English and French.

When I'm not at school I take piano lessons, animation/art classes, spend time online (instagram, pinterest, snapchat, etc...) as well as communicate with my friends and family, draw and do my makeup.

What kind of bagel can fly? A plain bagel.
I would like to learn as much about coding, computers and any other concepts covered in this course, as I possibly can. It's a subject that I have very limited knowledge on.

I've used Google Drive and all the programs in it (docs, slides, etc...) 
I think that just about covers everything, I'm so excited to learn about everything this class has to offer!
