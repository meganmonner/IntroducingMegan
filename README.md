<h1>Hello! My name is Megan Monner.</h1>
<p id="red">I was born and raised in Ottawa, living with my parents Mike Monner and Sharleen MacCarthy.<br>
I attended Glen Cairn Public School in grade seven and eight.</p>

<p id="orange">I love drawing and anything artistic. I've always been interested in drawing and designing unique characters. I fancy writing short stories as well as reading them. Ocassionally I do poetry. As you can probably tell I'm very artistic, I don't enjoy sports AT ALL. I also enjoy watching youtube videos and doing adult coloring.</p>

<p id="yellow">I don't really have a specific music taste. I tend to like anything, whether it's rock, hip-hop, or alternative/indie.<br>
I do lean more towards the indie/alternative side of the broad musical spectrum. <em>HOWEVER</em>, I absolutely despise rap and country! Secondly, I have so many favourite songs! But my all-time favourite is probably Caress Your Soul by Sticky Fingers.</p>

<p id="green">I don't have a favourite actor or actress, nor do I watch movies on a regular basis... but if I had to pick a favourite movie it would be Big Hero 6.<br>
My favourite food is probably fruit (<em>I like most fruit but I can't choose!</em>). The reason being is that it's like a healthy dessert- full of essentiel vitamins and minerals but tastes <strong>sweet and sugary</strong>.</p>

<p id="blue">I don't have a part-time job but hope to get one soon in order to save up for post-secondary education (i.e college and/or university).<br></p>

<h2>My strengths:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I'm creative
  <li>I'm patient
  <li>I'm funny with my friends
</ul>

<h2>My weaknesses:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Somewhat of a slow learner
  <li>Lack of concentration and motivation in things I don't enjoy or find interesting
  <li>I'm not a very hard worker, but I try
  <li>I have the memory of a goldfish
</ul>

<p id="purple">I speak English and French

When I'm not at school I take piano lessons, animation/art classes, spend time online (instagram, pinterest, snapchat, etc...) as well as communicate with my friends and family, draw and do my makeup.</p>

<p id="red">What kind of bagel can fly? A plain bagel.
I would like to learn as much about coding, computers and any other concepts covered in this course, as I possibly can. It's a subject that I have very limited knowledge on.</p>

<p id="orange">I've used Google Drive and all the programs in it (docs, slides, etc...) 
I think that just about covers everything, I'm <em>so</em> excited to learn about everything this class has to offer!</p>
