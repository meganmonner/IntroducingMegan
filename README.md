Salut! My name is Megan Monner.
I was born and raised in Ottawa, living with my parents Mike Monner and Sharleen MacCarthy.
I attended Glen Cairn Public School in grade seven and eight.
I love drawing and anything artistic. I've always been interested in drawing and designing unique characters, cartoon and animation too. I fancy writing short stories aswell as reading them. Ocassionally I do poetry. As you can probably tell I'm very artistic, I don't enjoy sports AT ALL. Oddly enough, I do enjoy physical education...
I don't really have a specific music taste. I tend to like anything with a nice beat, whether it's rock, hip-hop, or alternative/indie.
I do lean more towards the indie/alternative side of the broad musical spectrum. HOWEVER, I absolutely despise rap and country! I can't pick a favourite song but I do have a top 3.
