Salut! My name is Megan Monner.
I was born and raised in Ottawa, living with my parents Mike Monner and Sharleen MacCarthy.
I attended Glen Cairn Public School in grade seven and eight.
I love drawing and anything artistic. I've always been interested in drawing and designing unique characters. I fancy writing short stories as well as reading them. Ocassionally I do poetry. As you can probably tell I'm very artistic, I don't enjoy sports AT ALL. Oddly enough, I do enjoy physical education...
I don't really have a specific music taste. I tend to like anything with a nice beat, whether it's rock, hip-hop, or alternative/indie.
I do lean more towards the indie/alternative side of the broad musical spectrum. HOWEVER, I absolutely despise rap and country! I can't pick a favourite song but I do have a top 3...?
I don't have a favourite actor or actress, nor do I watch movies on a regular basis... but I do have favourite movies; Mean Girls and Big Hero 6.
My favourite food is probably fruit (I like most fruit but I can't choose!). The reason being is that it's a healthy dessert- full of essentiel vitamins and minerals but tastes sweet and sugary.
I don't have a part-time job but hope to get one soon in order to save up for post-secondary education (i.e college and/or university).
My strengths:
  -Creativity
  -Kindess
  -
 My weaknesses:
  -Somewhat of a slow learner
  -Lack of concentration and motivation in things I don't enjoy or find interesting
I speak English and French
